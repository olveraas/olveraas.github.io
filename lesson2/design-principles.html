                <p>The rule of thirds is applied by bringing into line a subject with the guidelines and their intersection points, allowing linear features in the image from section to section. The key is for perceiving the rule of thirds is to the placement of the subject at the center other reason is to prevent a horizon from appearing to divide the picture in half.</p>

                <p>Alignment is an important fundamental of design since it helps create a sharp, ordered appearance by ensuring the elements have a pleasing connection with each other. Aligning objects properly will clean up a design and eliminate the messiness or sloppiness that can occur when elements are placed randomly.

                <img src="images/tula.jpg" alt="tula website"/>
                <p>Contrast happens when two design elements are in opposition to each other, like blue and pink, thick and thin, modern and traditional, etc. Contrast is what helps guide the viewerâ€™s eyes to the most important parts of your design and helps organize the information in an easily digestible.
