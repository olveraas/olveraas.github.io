                <p>The home page of justinmind.com is a perfect example of an effective use of visual hierarchy. The first thing to catch your eyes is the brief description of what the focus is about. Having it in a large bold font makes it really stand
                    out, catching the users eyes. This is then followed up with another text below it, but at a smaller size, causing your eyes to follow that direction without taking anything away from the main text which leads perfectly to a call to
                    action, being the download button.

                <p>The home page for this website, I believe, used contrast in a very simple way by using color. While browsing I found they used a change in color to indicate new or different content. Doing this allows them to effectively differentiate
                    their content that is easy for the user to comprehend. Their color use also helps them contrast content they would like the user to focus more on by having it stand out more, such as using a bright color to catch the users attention.

                <p>In a very simple manner Scorptec utilizes the principle of repetition with their call to action buttons, either as 'click for details' or 'add to cart', with all products provided by the company. This do this by repeating the same color
                    in all cases which reinforce the continuity that will lead to more details about the product or to add to cart for them to buy. They also repeat the same font, size and location for all the prices for their products which makes it
                    easier for users to locate and identify the price regardless of which page you are on.</p>
